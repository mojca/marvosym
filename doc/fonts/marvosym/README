MarVoSym is Martin Vogel's Symbols font.  It contains many useful
symbols, especially for office and civil engineering purposes.

This marvosym package contains additional support files for TeX; any
questions or comments about it should go to its current maintainer,
not Martin.

Original TrueType font creator: Martin Vogel
Type 1 derivative, TeX macros, documentation:
    Thomas Henlich (original package)
    Mojca Miklavec (updates; current maintainer)

With special thanks to:
    Karl Berry (many useful comments)

Contact info, urls: see OFL.txt.

Licensing: fonts under OFL; TeX support files under LPPL.
And one other special case:
  The marvosym.pdf file comes from Martin's original marvosym.zip
  distribution, with this applicable license statement:
    "The Archive MARVOSYM.ZIP is freely distributable."
  Unfortunately this does not permit modification; also, its source is
  not available.  We have been unable to contact Martin to discuss it.
  Therefore marvosym.pdf is available on CTAN, but not in free/libre
  distributions such as TeX Live.

Installation: for TeX, your TeX distribution should already provide the
package.  If you need to install it yourself, you can download it from
CTAN (http://ctan.org/pkg/marvosym) and then see
http://tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html.

To install for non-TeX (native) use on Windows, copy the .ttf
into your system font directory or otherwise follow Windows procedures.
