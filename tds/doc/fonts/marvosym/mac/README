The folders in this folder contain Mac versions of the Marvosym fount and configuration files to set up OzTeX to use these founts. To use them with LaTeX, you also need the marvosym package used by everyone else, kept in the folder above this.This Mac version of Marvosym is based on the Y&Y re-worked version of Marvosym, and the metrics are very slightly different to the original.  For this reason, you should use the tfm file in OzTeX:TeX-fonts:Misc: rather than the original tfm file.The system fount files themselves are kept in the file the_font.bin, which is a MacBinary encoded Stuffit compressed archive. This should not be decoded or decompressed until it's safely on a Mac. StuffitExpander from http://www.aladdinsys.com will do the job.
